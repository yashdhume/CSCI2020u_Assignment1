BRAVE THE FUTURE 48-HOUR HACKATHON CHALLENGE
On Friday, February 8, 20 students began a 48-hour hackathon to develop the app that would bring the Brave The Future campaign to life. Advancement hosted The Brave the Future Hackathon Challenge in the Software Informatics and Research Centre (SIRC). Students were tasked with developing an app prototype that would engage users to explore the university’s Brave The Future fundraising campaign. In total, five teams participated in the challenge—with many working round-the-clock to complete their prototypes!

On the Sunday afternoon, student teams presented their app prototypes in live five-minute pitches to a panel of judges. The judging panel included Andrew Hogue, Associate Professor, Game Development and Entrepreneurship; Chris Woods, Manager, Web and Digital Media Services; and industry partner, Isaac Wanzama, Founder and Senior Strategist at geekspeak, a local e-commerce marketing agency. The judges were impressed with the enthusiasm of the teams and the quality of work produced in such a short time.

Congratulations to the winning team, Yash Dhume, Vincent Galloro, Kashif Hussain and Aabid Mitha, second year Computer Science Program students. They produced an app prototype with a sleek design that focuses on connecting the student and donor experience. The app includes fun and interactive Brave The Future games, allowing students to collect “brave coins” and indicate their interest in university events and future projects. The app also includes an interactive database of various university buildings and locations for prospective students and donors to learn more about the university and its facilities.

The winning team was awarded a prize of $5,000 and will also have the opportunity to earn an additional $5,000 by working with Advancement to refine and finalize their app over the coming months. When complete, the winning app will become an interactive component of the Brave The Future campaign.
